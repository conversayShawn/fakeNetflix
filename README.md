# Fake "Netflix" App

This is just a basic static app with an array of movies and tv shows I enjoyed in the 90s that can be used to test end-to-end and component tests with [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/).

## Cypress Installation

```
// Install deps
npm i 

// Start react server and cypress open
npm run cy:react
```



### Note: If you want to just start your react app, run `npm start`
